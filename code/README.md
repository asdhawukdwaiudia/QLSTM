# QLSTM

## Environment Dependencies

This project depends on the following environments:

- **VQNet**: VQNet is a crucial environment dependency that provides construction of quantum and classical AI models

- **Qpandalite**: Qpandalite is another key environment dependency used for using real quantum computing resources and quantum simulations

## Installation

### VQNet

First, you need to install VQNet. You can find the installation guide on the official website of VQNet.

### Qpandalite

Next, you need to install Qpandalite. You can find the installation guide on the https://github.com/Agony5757/QPanda-lite.


Please ensure that both environments are correctly installed and configured for your code to run properly.Their environmental dependencies can be found on their respective websites.


In order for code to run smoothly, you may need to purchase a certain amount of quantum computing resources
